# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This paper evaluates the short-term causal effects of a coding bootcamp on a sample of beneficiary women in Argentina and Colombia. To do so, we randomly allocate a scholarship to cover most of the tuition costs of the training. We measure the impacts of the bootcamp on participants' coding skills, as well as on their probability of finding a job in technology. Moreover, we compare the employment situation of our sample before and during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak to investigate whether the program increased participants' resilience to a downturn in the labor market."
