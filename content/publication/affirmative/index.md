# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We study the primary employment-based affirmative action regulation in the U.S.: Executive Order 11246. In particular, we estimate the causal effects of the regulation on workers' earnings and future employment prospects. We do so by exploiting different features specified by the policy in a regression discontinuity setting. The project circumvents prior data limitations by constructing the first large-scale administrative database containing worker-level information (from the restricted access matched employer-employee LEHD data) together with the federal contractor status of their employers (from EEOC Data and Federal Procurement Data). Motivated by our empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model in order to identify the different mechanisms through which the policy operates. Our results may suggest important margins to consider when designing policies to address racial inequalities."
