In particular, we estimate the causal effects of the regulation on workers' earnings and future employment prospects. We do so by exploiting different features specified by the policy in a regression discontinuity setting. The project circumvents prior data limitations by constructing the first large-scale administrative database containing worker-level information (from the restricted access matched employer-employee LEHD data) together with the federal contractor status of their employers (from EEOC Data and Federal Procurement Data). Motivated by our empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model in order to identify the different mechanisms through which the policy operates. Our results may suggest important margins to consider when designing policies to address racial inequalities.","tags":[],"title":"The Effect of Affirmative Action on Workers' Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Work in Progress (draft coming soon) - joint with Ana Goicoechea (The World Bank) and Mushfiq Mobaraq (Yale)"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596735329,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596735329,"objectID":"87fb05f9e544315d6ed24be3ba90e5d1","permalink":"/publication/bootcamp/index-julians-macbook-pro.locals-conflicted-copy-2021-01-29/","publishdate":"2020-08-06T12:35:29-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bootcamp/index-julians-macbook-pro.locals-conflicted-copy-2021-01-29/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper evaluates the short-term causal effects of a coding _bootcamp_ on a sample of beneficiary women in Argentina and Colombia.

Exploiting arbitrary variation in the program's intervention borders, we use a geographical regression discontinuity design to identify the program's effects on agricultural outcomes. Pre-treatment balance tests show that producer and farm- level pre-treatment characteristics evolve smoothly at the intervention border. Results indicate that farmers within treated areas improved pest knowledge and are more likely to implement prevention and control practices. Also, they increased fruit production and sales.

To meet this objective, this study measures the impact of the CRIAR, an agricultural technology adoption program implemented in highly food insecure areas of rural Bolivia. The paper analyzes whether changes in food security are due to improved food availability (production and local sales) and/or greater food access (income and production used for home consumption). To this end, data from a sample of 1287 households (817 beneficiaries and 470 controls) interviewed specifically for this purpose are used. To address self-selection issues, the program's impact is estimated using an instrumental variable model. The results present evidence that program participation improved food security. Specifically, positive impacts on agricultural productivity, agricultural sales and household income are found. These findings confirm the importance of considering agricultural programs as policy tools to address food insecurity.","tags":[],"title":"Sowing for Food Security: A Case Study of Smallholder Farmers in Bolivia","type":"publication"}]
